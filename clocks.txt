Summary of:
Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System

- What is the addressed problem and why is it important to address?
        - time-ordering of events in distributed system
        - necessary to know if messages passed in distributed system
        are before/after other messages

- What has been done?
        - Lamport timestamps:  arbitrary clock in each of a
        distributed system, events come one after another.  When from
        another system, can be determined if after another event based
        on arrival.
